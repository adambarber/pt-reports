This is a simple [Sinatra]("http://www.sinatrarb.com/")-based app to summarize Pivotal Tracker
stories that have been completed in the last week.  The output is grouped by label, and sorted
alphabetically.

Url format is: `http://pt-reports.heroku.com/PROJECT_ID/API_KEY`

You can download this code to your own server, or use the sample app on heroku.

The idea with this report is that it can be sent to an audience who isn't in the project tracker regularly.  It includes
the story descriptions, so readers don't need to go back to the tool to understand what was fixed.
